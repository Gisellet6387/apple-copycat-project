***Reflection:***
*The reason I did this project was to test my knowledge and understanding on html and css. What I learned through doing this project is how to create a button and upload icons to my project. For example, in my project I had to add the apple logo and a search button and shop button. I used some of my knowledge on html and css to style the button size and what color it would turn or where it would take the user when pressed, but eventhough I knew some things there were other things I had to learn on my own. For instance, I had to learn how to upload icons to my code and how to change their size. I also learned a little more on how to position my text where I wanted it to be positioned and how to add links to the buttons when pressed. Althought there were many times I would get stuck and run in to many bugs I figured it out using my notes and googling other examples on the thing I was trying to figure out. In the end with hard work and using both my notes and knowledge this was my outcome of my copycat-project of apple so check it out in the link below.*
